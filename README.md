# Kid-Friendly-PDX

The Kid-Friendly PDX app is a review and recommendation guide for kid-friendly places in Portland, Oregon. Users can search places by keyword and filter by category and neighborhood. Users can also contribute reviews of existing places, including text, rating, and photos. 

## Motivation

As a parent of a toddler, I am always looking for places I can take my kid where I won't offend anyone with his sudden tantrums or general unpredictability. Lists of kid-friendly places are posted on various parent guides and to some extent on Yelp and Google, but I wanted to make a centralized guide where the reviews are focused on the kid-friendliness, not just the places themselves. Does the restaurant have a play area and/or toys? How are the restrooms, seating, wait time and parking? For a museum, what age ranges would be appropriate? For parks, are there playground features for all ages? The Kid-Friendly PDX app attempts to answer all of these questions and more.

## How It Works

From the landing page, users can use the search form to start searching places and/or filtering by category or neighborhood. No initial signup or login is necessary for searching. From the results list view, users can select an individual place to see more details about it. From the details page, they can click on the Review or Write a Review buttons, but they must first log in to proceed. Users can sign up with an account or use the demo@demo.com/demo123 account to log in. At that point, they can write a review and post images.
